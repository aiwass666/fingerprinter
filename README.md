Browser Fingerprinting Demo

This demo provides a solid foundation by collecting several key pieces of information often used for browser fingerprinting. The canvas and audio fingerprints are particularly powerful because they rely on subtle differences in hardware and software to generate a unique identifier.

Do note that this demo can be downloaded and run in your browser to see the information available. The online demo does not save any data as it uses the same code listed in the demo.html above.
